The history of India and Pakistan's territorial dispute over the Kashmir region is a major factor in their adversarial relations.

The relationship between India and Pakistan is a complex and sensitive topic. They are two neighboring countries with a shared history, but they have been engaged in a territorial dispute over Kashmir since the partition of India in 1947. The dispute has led to several wars, including the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, and the Kargil War in 1999. The relationship between the two countries has been marked by periods of hostility, including the 1999 Kargil War and the 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament. In recent years, there have been efforts to improve relations, including a peace process initiated by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2004. However, the relationship remains tense, with frequent clashes along the Line of Control, a de facto border between the two countries.
